# Monkeypox-data-analysis
problem statement :

The recent outbreak of monkeypox has raised significant public health concerns globally. The objective of this project is to analyze the monkeypox dataset to uncover insights regarding the spread and impact of the disease across different regions and demographics.

conclusions / insightes from the data:

Project Conclusion: Monkeypox Dataset Analysis:

Demographics Most Affected Age Distribution: The data provided age groups in a non-uniform format, with many entries like "20-44." After filtering, a noticeable portion of the cases belonged to this age group. While more analysis is needed, there is a tendency toward middle-aged adults. Gender: Most of the confirmed cases with recorded gender were male. This suggests that males might be more prone to contracting monkeypox, but it's important to note that many entries had missing gender information.
Location-Specific Insights Concentration of Cases: The majority of the cases in the dataset were reported from London, England. It indicates a significant cluster in this region during the outbreak, though other regions might have also seen cases that were not captured in the dataset. Travel History: Some patients had travel history to regions like Nigeria, indicating that travel might be a factor in the spread of monkeypox, particularly from endemic areas.
Temporal Trends Date of Onset and Confirmation: By visualizing the timeline of case onset and confirmation, we observed that a spike in cases occurred around May 2022. This suggests a surge of infections during this period, aligning with the global reporting of monkeypox outbreaks around the same time. Delay in Diagnosis: There appears to be a delay between the onset of symptoms and confirmation of the disease, suggesting potential gaps in early diagnosis or reporting.
Symptoms and Clinical Presentation Common Symptoms: The most frequently reported symptom was a vesicular rash, followed by more general symptoms like fever and rash. This highlights the importance of identifying skin lesions as a primary symptom of monkeypox. Hospitalization and Isolation: A significant number of patients were isolated, but hospitalization data was incomplete, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the severity of cases.
Genomics and Strain Information The majority of the confirmed cases were associated with the West African Clade of the monkeypox virus, which is known to have a lower mortality rate compared to other clades. This aligns with global data indicating the predominance of this strain in recent outbreaks.
